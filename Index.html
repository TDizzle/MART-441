            I am a Media Arts major, hoping to graduate soon. I was surprised to find I made the Deans list last year. 
            <br>
            I currently work as a technician at Grizzly Harley-Davidson in Missoula, assembling new inventory and test driving vehicles. I also get underpaid to design advertisemnts for GHD and Russell Motorsports.

            I enjoy riding motorcycles in the summer and snowboarding in the winter.
            I was recently deployed to Kuwait where I trained on Abrams tanks for a year in the middle of nowhere.
