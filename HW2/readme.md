Week 2

Chat GPT created a script in seconds, while it took me a couple hours to figure everything out :(

I have very little understanding of javascript but I can ask chat gpt to create something along the lines of what I'm looking for and the file functions perfectly.

I think Chat GPT can be a great asset and help us learn things faster, but I can also see how easily it can be abused. 

No the work that I ask Chat GPT to do for me is not my own work, especially if I can't understand most of it.
